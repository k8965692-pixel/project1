# Document Scan Site

React and Vite app for scanning package labels with browser-based OCR.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

Push the project to a GitHub repository with the default branch named `main`.
Then, in the repository, open **Settings > Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**, and push to `main`. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and publishes the app automatically.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some Oxlint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the Oxlint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and Oxlint's TypeScript related rules in your project.
